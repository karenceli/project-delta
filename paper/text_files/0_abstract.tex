\par People tend to behave differently when facing risk decisions, showing a 
more obvious sensitivity towards losses than the same amount of gains. With the 
help of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and statistical methods, 
recent studties have obtained findings in the risk-aversion behaviors' neural 
basis. In this project, on one hand, we aim at reproducing methods described in 
\textit{The Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in Decision Making} while adding our
own thoughts to it. On the other hand, we devote ourselves to exploring other 
methods in this area even though we might draw a different conclusion from the 
paper.
